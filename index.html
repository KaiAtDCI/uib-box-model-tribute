                            Philip K. Dick was born in Chicago in <strong>1928</strong> 
                            and lived most of his life in California. He briefly attended 
                            the University of California, Berkeley but dropped out before 
                            completing any classes.

                            In <strong>1952</strong>, he began writing professionally and 
                            proceeded to write numerous novels and short-story collections.

                        <li>
                            He won the Hugo Award for the best novel in <strong>1962</strong> 
                            for The Man in the High Castle.
                        <li>
                           In <strong>1974</strong>he won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award 
                           for best novel of the year for Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.

                        <li>
                            In addition to 44 published novels, Dick wrote approximately 
                            121 short stories, most of which appeared in science fiction 
                            magazines during his lifetime. Although Dick spent most of his 
                            career as a writer in near-poverty, ten of his stories have been 
                            adapted into popular films since his death, including Blade Runner, 
                            Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly, Minority Report, Paycheck, Next, 
                            Screamers, and The Adjustment Bureau. In 2005, Time magazine 
                            named Ubik one of the one hundred greatest English-language novels
                            published since 1923. In 2007, Dick became the first science fiction 
                            writer to be included in The Library of America series.
